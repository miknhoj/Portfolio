            Iâ€™m a full stack web developer with a love of learning. I enjoy the process of finding a solution to a problem and finding new and creative ways to make something better. Highly coachable; adaptable to change; eager to learn; works well with others; strong communicator; a recovering perfectionist learning to  get out of my comfort zone and to seek discomfort to grow as a person.

            I decided to take this journey to become a web developer a few months ago. I wasn't finding fulfillment in the current career that I had. I wanted a job where I could continue to learn new things and grow as a person. I wanted a career that was challenging and rewarding. At the recommendation of a friend, I started to look into coding. I was hesitant, because I didn't know anything about coding and always thought it was something I couldn't do. I instantly fell in love. I quickly enrolled into the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. In three short months I learned to become a full stack web development. I know I still have so much more to learn, but I finally found something that I truly enjoy.
